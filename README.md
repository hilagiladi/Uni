- **Degree Programs:** Organize courses into degree programs, allowing students to easily track their progress towards graduation.

- **Data Initialization:** Automate the process of populating the course database with initial data using the DataInitializer class.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Facilitates rapid application development with its pre-built templates and features.

- **Hibernate**: Provides seamless object-relational mapping (ORM) for database operations.

- **MySQL**: A robust and scalable relational database management system.

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For front-end development and user interface design.

## Upcoming Features

- **Grading and Evaluation:** Enhance the grading system for course assessments, introducing automated grading, detailed assessment criteria, and tools for providing valuable feedback.
